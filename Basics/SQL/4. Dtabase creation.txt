Creating a Database
--------------------

Initial Size
- You can set an initial size for the database when creating it.
- It automatically grows when it reaches the set limit.
- This is similar to how a vector expands in C++ when its capacity is exceeded.

--------------------

File Path
- You can choose custom paths to store:
  1. Data file (.mdf) — holds database data.
  2. Log file (.ldf) — records all transactions for recovery.

--------------------

Recovery Model
- Full Recovery:
  - Allows restoring the database to any specific point in time.
  - Suitable for critical systems that need full data protection.

- Other Recovery Models (like Simple or Bulk-Logged):
  - Do NOT support point-in-time recovery.
  - They may lose some transaction history.
