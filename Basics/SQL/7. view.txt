View
--------------------

- A **view** is like a **virtual table** that displays data from one or more tables.
- It does **not store data physically** in the database — just stores the SQL query.
- A view must have a **unique name** in the database (just like a table).
- A view contains a **predefined SQL query** used to fetch data.
- Views can combine data from **multiple tables** and even **multiple databases** (if supported).

Syntax to create a view:
CREATE VIEW ViewName AS
SELECT Column1, Column2
FROM TableName
WHERE SomeCondition;

Example:
CREATE VIEW EmployeeView AS
SELECT ID, Name, Department
FROM Employees
WHERE Status = 'Active';

- You can also use SSMS GUI to create a view easily (Right-click on "Views" → New View...).
