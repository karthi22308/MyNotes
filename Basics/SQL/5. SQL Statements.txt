SQL Statements
--------------------

- SQL is used to communicate with databases.
- It helps update, retrieve, insert, and delete data.
- Most RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems) use SQL.
- Common SQL commands: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP.

--------------------

Types of SQL Statements
--------------------

1. DML – Data Manipulation Language  
2. DDL – Data Definition Language  
3. DCL – Data Control Language  
4. TCL – Transaction Control Language  

--------------------

DML – Data Manipulation Language
--------------------

- Used to manipulate data in the database.
- Commands: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- Allows storing, modifying, retrieving, and deleting data.

INSERT Syntax  
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);

--------------------

DDL – Data Definition Language
--------------------

- Used to define and manage database structure (schemas).
- Commands: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE.

CREATE Example  
CREATE TABLE Students (Rank INT, StudentName VARCHAR(50));

ALTER Example  
ALTER TABLE Students ADD Age INT;

- ALTER can add/modify/drop columns or rename tables and objects.

DROP Example  
DROP TABLE Students;

- Completely deletes the table, its data, schema, indexes, triggers, and permissions.

TRUNCATE Example  
TRUNCATE TABLE Students;

- Deletes all rows from a table WITHOUT logging individual row deletions.
- Cannot use WHERE clause.
- Faster than DELETE.
- Not recoverable (no logs).

DELETE vs TRUNCATE  
- DELETE: Logs each row deleted, can use WHERE, recoverable.  
- TRUNCATE: No logging, deletes everything, not recoverable, faster.

--------------------

DCL – Data Control Language
--------------------

- Used to control access to data.
- Commands: GRANT, REVOKE.

GRANT Example  
GRANT UPDATE ON Students TO John WITH GRANT OPTION;

- Gives John permission to update data and also grant that permission to others.

REVOKE Example  
REVOKE DELETE ON Students FROM Anderson;

- Removes previously given DELETE permission from Anderson.

--------------------

TCL – Transaction Control Language
--------------------

- Used to manage transactions (group of SQL statements treated as a unit).
- Commands: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT.

COMMIT Example  
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Students SET Rank = 1 WHERE StudentName = 'John';
COMMIT;

- Saves the transaction permanently.

ROLLBACK Example  
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Students SET Rank = 1 WHERE StudentName = 'John';
ROLLBACK;

- Cancels changes made in the transaction (only before COMMIT).

SAVEPOINT Example  
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Students SET Rank = 1 WHERE StudentName = 'John';
SAVE TRANSACTION SavePoint1;
UPDATE Students SET Rank = 2 WHERE StudentName = 'Alice';
ROLLBACK TRANSACTION SavePoint1;

- Goes back to SavePoint1, keeps earlier updates.
