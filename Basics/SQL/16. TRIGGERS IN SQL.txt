TRIGGERS IN SQL
--------------------

Triggers are special stored procedures that are executed automatically in response to database events.

Types of Triggers:
- DML Triggers: Respond to INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations.
- DDL Triggers: Respond to CREATE, ALTER, DROP operations.
- LOGON Triggers: Respond to LOGON events.

--------------------
SYNTAX - DML TRIGGER
--------------------
create trigger [trigger_name]
on [table_name]
after [insert], [update], [delete]
[not for replication]
as
begin
    -- SQL statements
end
go

--------------------
EXAMPLE - AFTER INSERT TRIGGER
--------------------
create trigger afterinsert
on workitem
after insert
as
begin
    insert into audit
    values (/* values here */)
end
go

--------------------
NOTES
--------------------
- Triggers can be disabled if needed.
- 'AFTER' specifies that the trigger should fire after the triggering action is performed.
- 'INSTEAD OF' triggers can be used to override the standard action.
