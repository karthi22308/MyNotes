SQL Clauses
--------------------

WHERE Clause
--------------------
- Used to filter records based on a condition.
- Comes **after FROM** and **before GROUP BY**.

Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2  
FROM table_name  
WHERE condition;

Example:
SELECT * FROM Employees  
WHERE Department = 'HR';

--------------------

ORDER BY Clause
--------------------
- Used to sort the result in **ascending** (default) or **descending** order.
- Comes **after WHERE or GROUP BY** clause.

Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2  
FROM table_name  
ORDER BY column1 ASC|DESC;

Example:
SELECT * FROM Products  
ORDER BY Price DESC;

--------------------

GROUP BY Clause
--------------------
- Used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns.
- Often used with aggregate functions: COUNT(), SUM(), MAX(), MIN(), AVG().
- Comes **after WHERE** and **before HAVING**.
- You can only **group by columns that appear in SELECT**.

Syntax:
SELECT column1, COUNT(*)  
FROM table_name  
GROUP BY column1;

Example:
SELECT COUNT(*), PostalCode  
FROM Customers  
GROUP BY PostalCode;

ðŸ’¡ More columns in GROUP BY = more detailed grouping.

--------------------

HAVING Clause
--------------------
- Used to filter records **after GROUPING**.
- Similar to WHERE, but used with **GROUP BY**.

Syntax:
SELECT column1, COUNT(*)  
FROM table_name  
GROUP BY column1  
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

Example:
SELECT COUNT(1) AS Count, Color, Size  
FROM Products  
GROUP BY Color, Size  
HAVING Size >= '44';

--------------------

LIMIT Clause (used in MySQL, SQLite)
--------------------
- Used to restrict the number of rows returned.

Syntax:
LIMIT [row_count];  
LIMIT [offset], [row_count];  
OR  
LIMIT [row_count] OFFSET [offset];

Example:
-- Get top 3 records:
SELECT * FROM Employees  
LIMIT 3;

-- Get second highest salary:
Option 1 (Using OFFSET):
SELECT DISTINCT Salary  
FROM Employee  
ORDER BY Salary DESC  
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

Option 2 (Using subquery):
SELECT MAX(Salary)  
FROM Employee  
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee);

--------------------

Common Notes
--------------------

- **VARCHAR** values in WHERE clause must be in **single quotes**.  
  Example: `WHERE FirstName = 'John'`

- **LIKE operator** is used for pattern matching.

Examples:
WHERE FirstName LIKE 'Mat%'    -- Starts with Mat  
WHERE Name LIKE '%son'         -- Ends with son  
WHERE Name LIKE '%al%'         -- Contains 'al'

- **MAX value** of a column:
SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees;

- **Aggregate functions** (like MAX, COUNT) return results without column names â€” use **aliasing** for clarity.

Example:
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS HighestSalary FROM Employees;
