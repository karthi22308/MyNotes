--> Types of Keys

consider a table student(studentid, name,class,dob,email)

candidate key is an attribute or set of attribute  that uniquely identifies a record or all eligible keys to be a primary key

candidate keys:
-studentid+email
-studentid
-email

-> primary key
 is a set of one or more fields of the table that uniquely identifies a record -> one of the candidate key

only one primary key should be there

should be chosen that attribute should never change

cannot be null

->secondary keys (alternate key)

secondary keys = candidate keys- primary key

it can work as a primary key

->unique key
is a set of one or more fields of the table that uniquely identifies a record similar to primary key only one difference is it can contain Null value -> non clustered index

->composite key
is a set of more than one attributes of the table that uniquely identifies a record

--> foreign key
filed in a table which is a primary key in another table
 null and duplicate values are allowed
