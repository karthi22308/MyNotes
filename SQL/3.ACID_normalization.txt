-> ACID properties


Transaction -> single logical unit of work

begin transaction
insert// update
commit all or all fails

end transaction
atomicity - all or executed or none should be executed

consistency - data integrity constraints -- correctness of database if column is of int tyoe varchar should not be allowed

Isolation - a transactions will be executed like its the only transaction - ensuring that transaction will not be affected by concurrent transaction -- locks on table to avoid interference

Durability - changes are persisted permanently in database
